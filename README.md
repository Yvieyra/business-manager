# Business Manager 

## Description
  The business manager program uses a NPM package called, inquirer, to use the terminal as a communication command line where questions can be asked and answers are stored and used to create a database using mysql2. In this specific prooject, we are answering questions that will be updating, displaying and adding rows/columns to our existing database tables. I have learned how important it is to have specific JOIN statements using mysql to put two tables together. Some tables may have extra information after being joined together.
